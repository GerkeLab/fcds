## fcds (in development)

### fcds 0.0.9

* Updated the FCDS import recoding specification for the 2019 FCDS release.

* Added `fcds_recoding()` to access and specify previous versions of the FCDS
  recoding specification.

* Added `year_group_levels` to `complete_year_groups()` to allow for custom
  year groups. Mostly for testing because the year groups change based on the
  FCDS release year.
